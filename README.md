Overview:
This document provides a method for automating the capture of TradingView alerts using Power Automate Desktop (PAD). The approach extracts essential details like the ticker name, signal type, current price, and time from TradingView notifications and logs them in a text file.

Key Components:

TradingView: A platform for creating custom alerts based on trading signals.
Power Automate Desktop: Microsoft's tool to automate tasks and interactions with the Windows desktop.
1. Setting Up TradingView Alerts

Step 1: Create Alerts in TradingView

Open TradingView and navigate to the chart where you want to set up the alert.
Click on the Alert button (either in the top menu or sidebar).
Customize the alert message to include essential trading information.
Example for Sell Signal:

Alert Name: PEPEUSDT
Message:
{{ticker}} Sell Signal! Current Price: {{close}} at {{time}}.
Example for Buy Signal:

Alert Name: PEPEUSDT
Message:
{{ticker}} Buy Signal! Current Price: {{close}} at {{time}}.
These placeholders dynamically populate the alert with data such as:

{{ticker}}: The symbol of the asset.
{{close}}: The asset's current price.
{{time}}: The time the alert triggers.
2. Setting Up Power Automate Desktop

Step 2: Install Power Automate Desktop

Download and install Power Automate Desktop from the Microsoft website.
Open Power Automate Desktop and create a new flow.
3. Creating a Flow in Power Automate Desktop

Step 3: Build the Flow to Capture Notifications

Open Power Automate Desktop and create a new flow.
Use the following steps to set up the flow:
Action 1: Get details from the TradingView Notification

Add the action "Get details of UI element in window" to capture the notification text.
Configure the UI element to target the TradingView notification.
Action 2: Clean up the captured text

Use "Replace text" action to remove any unwanted text from the notification.
Set Text to parse to %AttributeValue%.
Set Text to find to New notification from TradingView,.
Leave the Replace with field blank to remove the text.
Store the result in a variable named %Replaced%.
Action 3: Write the log to a file

Add the action "Write text to file".
Set Text to write as:
%CurrentDateTime% - %Replaced%
Save the log to a text file (e.g., C:\Notifications\Log.txt).
Action 4: Click the Notification (Optional)

Optionally, add a "Click UI element" action to automatically dismiss the notification after logging the information.
4. Testing the Flow

Step 4: Trigger the TradingView Alert

Test the setup by triggering a TradingView alert based on your signal.
The Power Automate Desktop flow will capture the notification text, process it, and store it in the log file.
5. Example of the Log Output

The following is an example of the logged alert after it has been captured by Power Automate Desktop:
